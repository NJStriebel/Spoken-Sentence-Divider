This Bible story tells us about our wonderful God who made us and who wants us to know Him.
God knows we have done bad things, which He calls sin.
The punishment for sin is death, but God loves us so much He sent His Son, Jesus, to die on a Cross and be punished for our sins.
Then Jesus came back to life and went home to Heaven!
If you believe in Jesus and ask Him to forgive your sins, He will do it!
He will come and live in you now, and you will live with Him forever.​
If you want to turn from your sins, say this to God: Dear God, I believe that Jesus died for me and now lives again.
Please come into my life and forgive my sins, so that I can have a new life now, and one day go to be with You forever.
Help me to live for You as your child.
Amen.​
Read the Bible and talk with God every day!
John 3:16
